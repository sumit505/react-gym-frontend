                        We want all people to enjoy the PlayZone experience and to do so all we need is an up-to-date and complete enrolment form for the first visit. It is important that throughout your membership, you keep this updated in case we need to use this information in an emergency. Our PlayZone sessions fill up fast and we recommend booking a place in advance (see ‘Bookings’ for more information).

                        We want to make sure everyone has the chance to use PlayZone so each booking is for 90 minutes. You are able to make a booking for PlayZone directly at this facility in club. Bookings can be cancelled free-of-charge up to 90 minutes prior. If you do not cancel, and do not attend your booking, you will be charged the full-fee per child. We do have members on a waiting list, and if you cancel, this will open the spot up for them. Unfortunately, if you do not cancel on several occasions, this may result in a temporary suspension from using the service
